                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Argentinian painter <a href="#">Néstor Ferronato</a> has worked in Italy since 1985 where he
                        lives by <b>puntualità svizzera</b> or Swiss
                        punctuality. Not only is he never late, he actually arrives well in advance of any
                        appointments.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>„My relationship with time is frantic — it’s never enough for me,” - he says „I wouldn’t
                            waste it ever. If I could, I’d
                            rather avoid sleeping, since we pass years doing that.”</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>Fascinated by the mechanisms of watches and clocks, Néstor started to make them his subjects.</h2>

                    <p><em>“I am obsessed with time passing by,”</em> he says, “but I never desired to become a
                        watchmaker. Maybe that was a mistake as
                        I’d probably be more wealthy by now!”</p>

                    <h3>He’s been intrigued by the inner workings of things since he was small. As a boy he would take
                        apart his toys</h3>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“I was trying to figure out what was making my tin-monkey move its arms and legs at the same
                            time,” he says. “I wanted
                            to understand why, pressing my toy car down while dragging it back, at my release it rushed
                            forward like a rocket.”</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h4>He began painting looping ribbons moving in and out of the watch parts.</h4>

                    <p>The ribbons symbolize the dynamism of the mechanical movement of a watch, a visual metaphor for
                        “the heart that makes the watch tick and the movements and complications that give it rhythm.”</p>
                    <p>Recently though Néstor has stopped using this technique so that other patterns in the watches
                        can become more visible. In these “post-ribbons” as he calls them, Néstor hides people and
                        objects within the watch workings for viewers to find. So in Prosit Breguet you can spot a
                        glass of red wine held by a hand between the yellow gear on the right and the support plate
                        where the logo is read. Above the wine glass two Breguet technicians look back at the viewer,
                        keen to see how their craftsmanship is being appreciated.</p>
